            <h2>Description</h2>
            <b>Originates from Jalisco, Mexico</b> Birria is a taco made with goat meat paired with a flavorful stew
            Birria seasonings vary greatly and depend not just on the regional style of birria you’re making but also on the cook. There are simple recipes that only call for some chiles and avocado leaves to more complex recipes that require many types of herbs and spices along with a variety of chiles.
            However you may choose to make it the result will be a punch of delicious flavors.
